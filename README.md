## Introduction

This tutorial is included as part of the GeoModeller v4.0 package, and is intended to be the third tutorial users should explore. This tutorial comes in six parts, corresponding to C1-C6. In all sections, users are provided with a **beginning** version and a **completed** version of the project, so that any section can be started by loading the beginning project of the that section, removing the requirement to complete all sections or to complete them in order.

### Tutorial C1

In this tutorial you will open an existing geological model and use various tools to display and visualise the data without making changes to the model itself.

You will learn how to:

* Use the 2D and 3D viewer to display models
* Examine the project metadata
* Recompute and review both 2D and 3D views of the geology model

### Tutorial C2

In this tutorial you will follow the general sequence required to perform a potential field forward calculation.

You will learn how to:

* Set physical properties for an electromagnetic model
* Set physical properties for a seismic model
* Perform a forward calculation to make a forward model for either electromagnetic or seismic

### Tutorial C3

In this tutorial you will define the rock properties for each formation and, if the properties you have chosen do not fit observed data, performing property optimisation on the magnetic properties. Then you will test if the optimisation was completed successfully.

You will learn how to:

* Configure and run Property Optimisation

### Tutorial C4

In this tutorial you will use a set of geological tests to explore how the geological boundaries are affected by "tightness" or "looseness" of available constraints, and evaluate if the changes to the 3D geology model are reasonable.

### Tutorial C5

In this tutorial you will set up and run a joint gravity-magnetism litho-constrained inversion.

You will learn how to:

* Set control mechanisms to limit the tendancy to randomness in geological predictions
* Visualise the misfit between the geological prediction and the calculated geological model
* Perform Statistical analysis on, and visulise in 2D and 3D, the results obtained

### Tutorial C6

In this tutorial you will use full tensor gravity grids to perform inversion and determine a geological model.

You will learn how to:

* Use FTG data to produce a geological model
* Check the produced grid versus the observed grid and determine the cause of any unexpected misfits
